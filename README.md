Fixing Augmented Reality 3D Vision Project

This project was conducted by Oskar Keding, Martin Brandt, Caroline Sauget, Julia Kenel.

The app was designed and tested on a Samsung Galaxy S10e.

For the calibration, this file is needed: "\fixing-ar\acircles_pattern.png"

Individual contributions of the different modules in the application:
- Settings Menu: Julia
- Calibration: Martin
- Aruco Marker Tracking: Martin and Oskar
- Face and Eye Detection: Caroline and Julia
- PerspectiveFixer (1st attempt): Martin and Julia. In this version, the method ....
- PerspectiveFixer (2nd attempt and final version): Oskar. In this version, the device corners are projected in the user's perspective and transformed to the camera perspective. 
Then they are defined as the new image corners. Julia and Martin helped with the Kalman filter.
